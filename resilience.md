# Introduction

<!-- ![TK: a venn diagram](https://i.imgur.com/DNFRd.jpg) -->

<div class="notes">
There is a vibrant, growing community of software developers who have
devoted themselves to civic and humanitarian problems. They may be passionate 
activists, community organizers, or concerned citizens; they are rarely 
businesspeople. This means their tools do not reach everyone they could. 
It means indefinite dependence on funding organizations. More importantly, 
it means missed opportunities for them and their projects.

Even a rudimentary understanding of the business world can open doors for
this movement and protect the hard work they've poured into these tools.
They can provide a safer home for their funder's investments. They can confidently
explore commercialization options. They can navigate disastrous intellectual
property issues. They can ensure that their tool is useful long after they've
moved on to their next project.

The Resilience Project provides a flexible curriculuum in the fields of business, 
law, and marketing that's tailored for amateur civic developers. That education is 
supported by an ongoing mentoring relationship with experienced professionals. 
Workshops on the mechanics of software product management, open source licensing, 
or marketing and brand development give them the familiarity and vocabulary they
need to more effectively work with foundations, government agencies, and potential 
investors. The mentors are neutral third parties who have no greater interest than
the long-term success of these projects and the personal fulfillment of their leaders.

# Project Goals

<div class="notes">
Many civic hackers have a generalized aversion or anxiety around business.
This often leads them to shun the notion of commercialization or outside
capital entirely.

Others are enthusiastic about their business, and are eager to commercialize
what they have. They are quickly overwhelmed by private equity and venture
capital, eager to take advantage of what they've done and even more eager to
take advantage of their lack of experience.

The Resilience Project intends to create a cohort of civic projects that _know
what they don't know_. They're not afraid to ask for help, and know where to go
when that happens. Our assumption is that educated, well-supported leaders with 
access to sound advice are more likely to explore sustainable options, less
likely to succumb to predatory interests, and can make themselves available to
every development option that make sense for their project.

| Born-again capitalists. | Projects that remain useful to stakeholders.

# Materials

## Coursework

**Orientation.**
:   First principles that can guide all subsequent decisions.

**Products and Services**
:   The basics of the software and consulting business.

**Relationships.**
:   Working with NGOs, foundations, customers, users, and stakeholders.

**Intellectual Rights.**
:   Safely sharing and protecting your work; copyright, licensing, and patents, 

**Communication.**
:   Getting the attention you deserve with marketing, events, and public relations.

**Community.**
:   Building a community infrastructure.

<div class="notes">
The material is divided into a number of modules, each with their own readings, workshops, and course work.
</div>

## Orientation

<div class="notes">
In Orientation, we encourage the project leaders to think critically about
their hopes and their limitations. They'll their motivations, the outcomes they
want for themselves and their users, and what sacrifices they'll be willing to
make.

By encouraging a self-aware and deliberative process, our leaders will be
better able to articulate their mission to stakeholders, and make more informed
decisions about the issues introduced later in the coursework. 

Some example discussions are included below:
</div>

**What's your appetite?**
:   Is this a hobby, or do you want to do this full-time?
:   How much money would keep you from working on this ever again?
:   Do you love the project, the people, or the mission?

**What's your exit?**
:   Are you time-bound?
:   Are you milestone-bound?
:   Using regret as a compass.

## Products & Services

<div class="notes">
Very few leaders have been involved in a professional sofware operation. This module helps them understand different aspects of the industry. 

</div>

**Business Models.**
:   Licensing, consulting, support contracts.

**Product Management.**
:   Managing roadmaps and triaging bugs.

**Quality Assurance.**
:   Code reviews, security, and test-driven development.

**Release Engineering.**
:   Understanding code reviews and product packaging.

## Relationships

<div class="notes">
In the Relationships module, the leaders are to think critically about the
stakeholders in their project, what those stakeholders expect of them, and how
they can make those relationships as productive as possible.
</div>

**Investors.**
:   Private equity, venture capital, and philanthropy.

**Customers.**
:   Creating a value proposition and basic sales principles.

**Users.**
:   Listening to your beneficiaries.

**Channel Partners.**
:   Resellers, VARs, and Distributors

## Intellectual Rights

<div class="notes">
A proper understanding of intellectual property is essential to any technology
business. Mishandled licensing, for example, can permanently damage the
reputation and future prospects of a young project. Especially in the field of
patents and open source software, laws and norms are unintuitive and quickly
overwhelm even experienced attorneys. The Intellectual Rights module won't turn
leaders into _a priori_ lawyers, but it will help them understand the issues
involved and know what questions to ask. 
</div>

**Copyright.**
:   How copyright applies to software.
:   How to properly manage a portfolio of software.

**Patents**
:   Understanding the patent regime.
:   Protecting the project from non-practicing entities.

**Open Source Licensing**
:   Choosing a license, managing community contributions.

## Communication

<div class="notes">
The majority of projects are advertised through word-of-mouth and exposure at conferences, which
is necessarily the most effective way to gain exposure. The Communication module encourges leaders
to understand and apply all possible routes to market, know which tools are most effective to
reach a particular audience, and how to measure their progress.
</div>

**Audiences.** 
:   Distinguishing funders, users, customers, vendors, and partners.

**Creating a brand.** 
:   Designs, creation, and upkeep.

**Tools.** 
:   Online, print, interactive, events, and analytics.

**Working with agencies and channels.** 
:   Collaborations, templates, and brand books.

## Community

<div class="notes">
While many civic software projects already have good grounding in open source
development models, they may not necessarily understand the importance of
community-building, or how that discipline functions in practice.

The Community module helps these projects understand the importance of
community-building, not just for the narrow technical community of
contributors to their project, but the larger communities they serve and
benefit from their work. By teaching them the fundamentals of
community-building, they can better grasp all the resources they have
available in the civic technology community and the local communities that
they serve.
</div>

**Taxonomy.**
:   Different kinds of communities.
:   Etienne Wenger and Karl Fogel's research.

**Tools.**
:   Different technology and methods for handling community work.

**Development.**
:   Strategies for seeding, measuring, and nurturing.
