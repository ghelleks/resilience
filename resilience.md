# Introduction

<!-- ![TK: a venn diagram](https://i.imgur.com/DNFRd.jpg) -->

<div class="notes">
There is a vibrant, growing community of software developers who have
devoted themselves to civic and humanitarian problems. They may be passionate 
activists, community organizers, or concerned citizens; they are rarely 
businesspeople. This means their tools do not reach everyone they could. 
It means indefinite dependence on funding organizations. More importantly, 
it means missed opportunities for them and their projects.

Even a rudimentary understanding of the business world can open doors for
this movement and protect the hard work they've poured into these tools.
They can provide a safer home for their funder's investments. They can confidently
explore commercialization options. They can navigate disastrous intellectual
property issues. They can ensure that their tool is useful long after they've
moved on to their next project.

The Resilience Project provides a flexible curriculuum in the fields of business, 
law, and marketing that's tailored for amateur civic developers. That education is 
supported by an ongoing mentoring relationship with experienced professionals. 
Workshops on the mechanics of software product management, open source licensing, 
or marketing and brand development give them the familiarity and vocabulary they
need to more effectively work with foundations, government agencies, and potential 
investors. The mentors are neutral third parties who have no greater interest than
the long-term success of these projects and the personal fulfillment of their leaders.

# Project Goals

<div class="notes">
Many civic hackers have a generalized aversion or anxiety around business.
This often leads them to shun the notion of commercialization or outside
capital entirely.

Others are enthusiastic about their business, and are eager to commercialize
what they have. They are quickly overwhelmed by private equity and venture
capital, eager to take advantage of what they've done and even more eager to
take advantage of their lack of experience.

The Resilience Project intends to create a cohort of civic projects that _know
what they don't know_. They're not afraid to ask for help, and know where to go
when that happens. Our assumption is that educated, well-supported leaders with 
access to sound advice are more likely to explore sustainable options, less
likely to succumb to predatory interests, and can make themselves available to
every development option that make sense for their project.
